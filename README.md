Jacob Delgado's Portfolio

Description: This is my first time using React, I built a portfolio website for myself displaying what I know and for anyone to get to know me. I used tailwind which expedited the process exponentially, my plan in the future is to build on this app to add animations and make it look more professional as I get more comfortable with react and using backend servers.
